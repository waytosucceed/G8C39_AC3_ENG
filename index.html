    <p class="text-start"> <br> ðŸ‘‰ The <b>simple present tense</b> describes habitual actions or universal truths; in
      active voice, it emphasises the doer (e.g., <b>She writes a letter</b>), while in passive voice, the focus shifts
      to the action or receiver (e.g., <b>A letter is written by her</b>). <br><br> ðŸ‘‰ The <b>simple past tense</b> refers
      to completed actions in the past; in active voice (e.g., <b>He repaired the car</b>), the subject performs the
      action, whereas in passive voice, the action is highlighted (e.g., <b>The car was repaired by him</b>). <br><br>
      ðŸ‘‰ The <b>present perfect tense</b> expresses actions that occurred at an indefinite time in the past with relevance
      to the present; in active voice (e.g., <b>They have completed the task</b>), the subject is key, while in passive
      voice (e.g., <b>The task has been completed by them</b>), the result is emphasised. <br><br>ðŸ‘‰ The <b>past perfect
        tense</b> indicates an action completed before another past action; in active voice (e.g., <b>She had finished
        the report</b>), the subjectâ€™s completion is noted, while in passive voice, the action takes precedence (e.g.,
      <b>The report had been finished by her</b>). </p>
